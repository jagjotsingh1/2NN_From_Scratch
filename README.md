# 2NN_From_Scratch
This is my implementation of 2 Layer Neural Network from scratch to better understand flow

For this mini project, I used the CIFAR training set to train and predict my model. 
The implementation uses the basic flow of how neural networks work by creating my own implementation of 
a forward pass, and backwards pass. Code comments on each function to better understand my thought process 
when working on this project. 

From this project I have gained:
- A better understanding of how forward pass, and backwards passes are being conducted
- Plotting and understanding the way the model was learning
- Implementing a machine learning model and training it using supervised learning
- A better appreciation for people who create the machine learning libraries :)
